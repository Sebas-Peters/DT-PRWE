<h2>Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation – Decision Tree Version<h2>

On this repository, you can find the questionnaire structure and a demo version of the decision tree (DT) version of the Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE): the DT-PRWE. The decision tree version of the questionnaire was developed by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09638288.2019.1566407"><u>Van der Oest et al. in Disability and Rehabilitation</u></a> in a collaboration between the Erasmus MC, Xpert Clinics, Xpert Handtherapie, and Western University Canada. The questionnaire structure is available both as an .xlsx file, which can be used to implement the decision-tree logic in other PROM systems, and as an .lss file, which can be directly uploaded into LimeSurvey to deploy the DT-PRWE in your own environment. 

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>What is the PRWE?</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;">The PRWE questionnaire is a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) filled in by patients with hand and wrist complaints to gain insight into the complaints and functioning of the affected area. The questionnaire has been developed by Prof. dr. Joy MacDermid in Canada. More information on the questionnaire and its psychometric properties can be found <a href="http://www.physio-pedia.com/PRWE_Score"><u>here</u></a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>What is a decision tree version of a questionnaire? </strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;">The decision tree version of the PRWE was developed to allow a faster and easier completion of the PRWE. The principle of a decision tree questionnaire is that based on the answers given on a question, the most discerning question is asked next. For example, when a patient answers on a question that the task is easy to perform, the next question will be about a task that most patients find more difficult. This way a score can be calculated with a limited number of questions that is highly similar to the score calculated when all questions were answered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>The DT-PRWE</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Using a large dataset of filled in PRWE questionnaires a decision tree was determined for both the sub-scores for pain and function and the total score of the PRWE. All three scores can be calculated by filling in only 6 of the total of 15 questionnaires contained in the questionnaire. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Inter-version reliability and agreement</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;">The decision tree version of the PRWE has high inter-version reliability and agreement with the original BCTQ, as found by Peters et al. Details on inter-version reliability and agreement, are available here.</span></p>
